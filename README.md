# 🌾 Rice Seed Variety Classification

This project focuses on classifying **Cammeo** and **Osmancik** rice seed varieties using **machine learning techniques**.  
The workflow includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training** with multiple algorithms, followed by performance evaluation using various metrics.

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset: Morphological features of rice grains (Cammeo & Osmancik varieties).  
- Format: CSV (`ricegrain_csv.csv`)  
- Features: Includes shape, size, and texture-based attributes of rice grains.

## 🔎 Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning and handling missing values  
   - Feature scaling/normalization  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Statistical summaries  
   - Visualizations of feature distributions & correlations  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Models: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and others  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision-Recall, Confusion Matrix  

---

## ✅ Results
- Identified the most effective classifier for distinguishing between **Cammeo** and **Osmancik** varieties.  
- Evaluated performance using multiple metrics, with Random Forest providing the best accuracy.  
- Confusion matrices and precision-recall curves demonstrate model effectiveness.
